The\\nword \"standard\" could sugge st that only one  (standard) procedure is to be used across all units.\\nThe term is sometimes used facetiously to refer to practices that are unconstructive, yet the norm. In the\\nPhilippines, for instance, \"SOP\" is the term for pervasive corruption within the gove rnment and its\\ninstitutions.[3][4]\\nIn clinical research, the International Counc il for Harmonisation (ICH) defines SOPs as \"detailed, written\\ninstructions to achieve uniformity of the performance of a specific function\". SOPs usually get applied in\\npharmaceutical processing and for related clinical studies. There the focus is always set on repeated\\napplication of unchanged processes and procedures and its documentation, hence suppor ting the\\nsegregation of origins, causes and effects. Further application is with triage, when limited resources get\\nused according to an assessment on ranking, urgence and staffing possibilities.[5] Study director is mainly\\nresponsible for SOPs. The Quality Assurance Unit are individuals who are responsible for monitoring\\nwhether the study r eport and tests are meeting the SOP.\\nSOPs can also provide employees with a reference to common business practices, activities, or tasks. New\\nemployees use an SOP to answer questions without having to interrupt supervisors to ask how an operation\\nis performed. The international quality standard ISO 9001  essentially requires the determination of\\nprocesses (documented as standard operating procedures) used in any manufacturing process that could\\naffect the quality of the produc t.[6]\\nProcedures are extensively employed to assist with working safely. They are sometimes called \"safe work\\nmethods statements\" (SWMS, pronounc ed as \\'swims\\'). Their development is usually preceded by various\\nmethods of analyzing tasks or jobs to be performed in a workplace, including an approach called job safety\\nanalysis, in which hazards are identified and their control methods described.
